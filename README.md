## Overview
Our project, WeCare, is devoted to the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 2: Zero Hunger. The mission of this SDG is to eradicate hunger globally by the year 2030. Through WeCare, we are striving to answer the pivotal question, "How might we educate young professionals on global food insecurity to help direct their donations to communities in need?"

Our hypothesis is that many young individuals are uninformed about the depth of the worldwide hunger issue. Thus, by shedding light on this crisis, we can empower them to make informed decisions regarding their charitable donations.

## Background

Hunger, a global challenge, is not just about food scarcity. Its root causes include factors like lack of awareness, poverty, conflicts, and political instability. Recent data from the UN highlights the gravity of this issue:

- "By 2022, about 735 million people, which equates to 9.2% of the worldâ€™s population, were chronically hungry. This marked a significant rise from 2019."
- "In 2022, 2.4 billion people faced moderate to severe food insecurity, which means they didn't have regular access to safe and nutritious food. This number surged by a staggering 391 million people compared to 2019 figures."

In the words of Daniel C., "Why is the public not more involved in a debate on the problem of world hunger? The problem of world hunger is inconceivable to those who live in comfortable surroundings, detached from the realities of the Third World."

The aim of our project is to bridge this gap of awareness, believing that enlightenment and awareness-building are vital tools in the battle against the global hunger crisis.
